## Assignment Overview
- You will design and build a MVP e-commerce application for a business of your choice. 

- The e-commerce applications should focus on 1 to 3 features maximum to limit the scope of the MVP product version.

- Develop a wireframe based on an analysis of 3-5 constructed user experience stories for the application.  The wireframe should represent the flow of your application and data.

## Application Overview
The features I decided to include in my application are:
- Dynamically resizing list of all products on the home page.
- To have multiple high quality images of a product from a product details page that can be enlarged when selected.
- To allow navigation from one product to the next without the need to return to the home page.

The business i chose for my e-commerce page is one that sells 3D printable files of articulating dragons.
All images where used come from the artist that goes by the name Cinderwing3D.  The website they use to advertise their models is <a href="https://www.cinderwing3d.com/">www.cinderwing3d.com</a>.  All of the images used in my site are models that I have purchased myself.
